# r/place-AvgColor
After I saw the r/place dataset, I had the idea recreate the image using the average color for each pixel
This project taught me a lot about how to work with data.tables, which I had not previously worked with.

I started out by writing all the neccesary functions from scratch without realizing there were libraries or built in functions that already did what I was trying to do.
